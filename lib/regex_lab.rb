  # check any word boundard (\b) to see if it starts with *any* character in []

  # \bun => check any word boundary to see if it starts with un
  # \w* => followed by zero or more of any word character (letter, num, underscore)
  # ing => followed by ing. note that this will catch weird cases like unningula
  # could do
  # \bun[a-zA-Z]+ing (would also catch weird cases)
  # \bun[a-zA-Z]+ing\b  # won't catch weird cases - makes sure ing is at the word boundary

  # could also do \bun\w+ing\b
  # could also do /un\w+ing/

def words_five_letters_long(text)
  text.scan(/\b\w{5}\b/)

  # \b => check any word boundary
  # \w{5} => for exactly 5 word characters
  # \b => followed by another word boundary (so you don't get words that are longer)

  #could also do \b[A-Za-z]{5}\b or /\b[a-z]{5}\b/

def first_word_capitalized_and_ends_with_punctuation?(text)
  !!text.match(/^[A-Z].*\W$/)

  # ^[A-Z] => check the beginning of the string for any capital letter
  # .* => followed by zero or more of any single character - can't do just word characters, because you'll miss spaces
  # \W$ => check the end of the sting for a non-word character (punctuation)

  # could also do ^[A-Z].+\W$
  # could also do ^[A-Z].*[\.!?]$ => [\.!?]$ looks for any of these characters at end
  # could also combine: !!text.match(/^[A-Z]/) && !!text.match(/\W$/)
  # could also do ^[A-Z].+\.$

def valid_phone_number?(phone)
  !!phone.match(/\W*\d{3}\W*\d{3}\W*\d{4}\b/)

  # \W* => check for 0 or more nonword characters - this allows room for spaces and () around numbers
      # e.g. (718)891-1313 or (718)891-1313
  # \d{3} => check for three digit characters
  # \W* => check for 0 or more nonword characters - same reason as above
  # \d{3} => check for three digit characters
  # \W* => check for 0 or more nonword characters - same reason as above
  # \d{4} => check for four digit characters
  # \b => then check for word boundary. otherwise you open yourself up to nums that are too long

  #could also do
  # (\d+).(\d+).(\d+)  => Works but leaves a LOT of holes

  # official soln regex: ([0-9] *){10}|(\([0-9]{3}\)(([0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4})|[0-9]{7})\b)
  # no clue what this is doing though
